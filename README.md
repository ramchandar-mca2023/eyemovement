Moves two pupils to the cursor position, while keeping them centered on the cursor.The code uses the clientX and clientY properties of the event object to get the cursor's position relative to the browser window.The code then calculates the pupil's new position as a percentage of the browser window's width and height.Finally, the code uses the translate() CSS transform to move the pupils to their new positions.This code can be used to create a variety of effects, such as making a character's eyes follow the cursor, or making a cursor appear to be followed by two pupils.

# Steps to Run the Project
Add the code to a web page. You can do this by creating a new <script> tag and pasting the code into it.Add two elements with the class pupil to the web page. You can do this by adding any HTML element, such as a

or  element, and giving it the class pupil.Open the web page in a web browser.Move the mouse cursor around the web page.
# Future Improvements
Make the pupils follow the cursor more smoothly.Add support for multiple cursors
